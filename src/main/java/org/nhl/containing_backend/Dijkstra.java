/**
 * We use a simple graph representation where the vertices are represented by a
 * Vertex class.
 * <p/>
 * Because we'll need to iterate over the successors of each vertex, we will
 * keep a list of edges exiting each vertex. For use by the algorithm later, we
 * have two other fields: minDistance: The shortest distance from the source to
 * this vertex in the graph. It is initialized to positive infinity (as large as
 * possible). previous: A reference to the previous vertex to get a shortest
 * path from the source vertex to this vertex. In addition, later in the
 * algorithm we will need to order the vertices. We made our class implement the
 * Comparable interface, and we will implement the actual comparison method
 * later.

/**
 * We're now prepared to define our method. We separate the computation into two
 * stages: Compute the minimum distance from the source to each vertex in the
 * graph. Simultaneously, keep track of the previous reference for each vertex v
 * that gives the previous vertex on the shortest path from the source vertex to
 * v. This is the expensive step.
 * <p/>
 * Later, any time we want to find a particular shortest path between the source
 * vertex and a given vertex, we follow the previous references to quickly
 * construct it. For the first part, we write computePaths, which takes as input
 * the source vertex from which all shortest paths are found.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The outline of how the function works is shown: we visit each vertex, looping
 * over its out-edges and adjusting minDistance as necessary. The critical
 * operation is relaxing the edges, which is based on the following formula: if
 * (u, v) is an edge and u is on the shortest path to v, d(u) + w(u,v) = d(v).
 * <p/>
 * In other words, we can reach v by going from the source to u, then following
 * the edge (u,v). Eventually, we will visit every predecessor of v reachable
 * from the source. The shortest path goes through one of these. We keep track
 * of the shortest distance seen so far by setting minDistance and the vertex it
 * went through by setting previous:
